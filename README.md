# Organizer

Hi and welcome! Here is my first Flutter / Firebase project. We can find a basic To Do App, orginized as follows; in the first page, we can add some groups, which we can edit and delete. Once clicked on a group, we naviguate into a new page, where we have the ability to add some new lists, inside which we can add some tasks. For each list and each task, we can delete or edit its title (for the list), and the title, the description ans the deadline (for the task). About the tasks, we can check it when it is completed.

Note that tasks are ordered by incresing deadline, but also by state, i.e. not completed tasks first, then completed tasks.
Lists and groups are alphabetically ordered.
